Fitness Tracker, ECG App, Always-On Retina Display, Water Resistant",4.4 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024","I upgraded from a series 5 40mm to this 10 42mm!I’m petite so the screen is a great size! I don’t know if a bigger size would have been too big on my little wrist. It’s just right!However- the only difference going from a rose gold series 5 40mm - was the watch has a bigger display. Honestly, Apple doesn’t change too much. The battery life is WAY BETTER THOUGH AND IT CHARGES FASTER! I like how thin it is too. Again, I’m petite so it’s not so clunky looking in my wrist from it being thinner .  I think a real upgrade would have been to get a titanium finish in gold or natural but I just stuck with what I had.All my 40mm bands fit perfectly!"
3,"Apple Watch Series 10 [GPS 46mm case] Smartwatch with Jet Black Aluminium Case with Black Sport Band - M/L. Fitness Tracker, ECG App, Always-On Retina Display, Water Resistant",4.4 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2024","I upgraded from a series 5. The battery life is phenomenal, I can literally go 2 days without charging. When I do have to charge it, it’s full in about 30mins. Price is on par for the quality. The health sensors are nice. I know I have sleep apnea, and never got around to taking care of it. The watch notified me after about a month of use, and provides data to bring in to the doctor’s office. The watch is very easy to use. Like upgrading any other Apple device, it was an easy transfer from the old watch, well worth the upgrade, and well worth the price.The watch looks great, I paired it with a AMBAND case. I feel that case adds a lot of protection to the watch, without impacting functionality. For additional durability, I also got a screen protector. I’m sure the screen is more durable than the series 5, but I like the added protection since I’m always working on things in the garage, around the house, and inadvertently scraping the watch along walls and concrete floors. If you’re hard on em’ get a quality case. Cases are cheap insurance anyways.If you’ve never had an Apple Watch, and are on the fence about buying one… just buy it, it’s more useful than you think. I never used to wear watches as a kid, then when cells phones came around, I figured I’d just pull my phone out to check the time… Well decades later, i finally got on the bandwagon, and turns out I use it all the time. It’s nice to quickly check weather forecast, start my car/truck, check and respond to a quick text, timers, walkie talkie, health data, and of course checking the time.The only time I take it off, is to shower. Even though you could shower and swim with it on, I find that’s the perfect time to charge it.Highly recommend."

The band (M/L) is a perfect fit. I love the slimmer profile of the Series 10 compared to the previous models. The watch works seamlessly with my iPhone 15 Pro and my MacBook.

I may even use different faces for different moods or events. Overall, I highly recommend the Apple Watch Series 10"

Fitness Tracker, ECG App, Always-On Retina Display, Water Resistant",4.4 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024","I upgraded from a series 5 40mm to this 10 42mm!I’m petite so the screen is a great size! I don’t know if a bigger size would have been too big on my little wrist. It’s just right!However- the only difference going from a rose gold series 5 40mm - was the watch has a bigger display. Honestly, Apple doesn’t change too much. The battery life is WAY BETTER THOUGH AND IT CHARGES FASTER! I like how thin it is too. Again, I’m petite so it’s not so clunky looking in my wrist from it being thinner .  I think a real upgrade would have been to get a titanium finish in gold or natural but I just stuck with what I had.All my 40mm bands fit perfectly!"

Fitness Tracker, ECG App, Always-On Retina Display, Water Resistant",4.4 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2024","I upgraded from a series 5. The battery life is phenomenal, I can literally go 2 days without charging. When I do have to charge it, it’s full in about 30mins. Price is on par for the quality. The health sensors are nice. I know I have sleep apnea, and never got around to taking care of it. The watch notified me after about a month of use, and provides data to bring in to the doctor’s office. The watch is very easy to use. Like upgrading any other Apple device, it was an easy transfer from the old watch, well worth the upgrade, and well worth the price.The watch looks great, I paired it with a AMBAND case. I feel that case adds a lot of protection to the watch, without impacting functionality. For additional durability, I also got a screen protector. I’m sure the screen is more durable than the series 5, but I like the added protection since I’m always working on things in the garage, around the house, and inadvertently scraping the watch along walls and concrete floors. If you’re hard on em’ get a quality case. Cases are cheap insurance anyways.If you’ve never had an Apple Watch, and are on the fence about buying one… just buy it, it’s more useful than you think. I never used to wear watches as a kid, then when cells phones came around, I figured I’d just pull my phone out to check the time… Well decades later, i finally got on the bandwagon, and turns out I use it all the time. It’s nice to quickly check weather forecast, start my car/truck, check and respond to a quick text, timers, walkie talkie, health data, and of course checking the time.The only time I take it off, is to shower. Even though you could shower and swim with it on, I find that’s the perfect time to charge it.Highly recommend."

Simple to use and fits wrist true to size. So far the battery life has been great with one  charge carrying me through the whole day (6am- 8pm). The bigger screen allows for easy viewing of messages and other notifications.

Quality, reliable, easy to use."

Fitness Tracker, ECG App, Always-On Retina Display, Water Resistant",4.4 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2024","I am fully entrenched in the Apple ecosystem and this watch is a great addition to my collection. The band (M/L) is a perfect fit. I love the slimmer profile of the Series 10 compared to the previous models. The watch works seamlessly with my iPhone 15 Pro and my MacBook. There is a little bit of a learning curve and it will take some trial and error to get the face layout and complications the way I want it, but it's so easy to customize the watch. I may even use different faces for different moods or events. Overall, I highly recommend the Apple Watch Series 10"
